    "\n",
    "We're in a library, and we are trying to find a book in a specific row of a shelf, and we know the books are **sorted alphabetically**.\n",
    "Instead of going from left to right (or from right to left), what we usually do is to pick some book from the middle, and check whether it's to the left or to the right of the book that we're searching.  Because the books are sorted alphabetically, we can discard one half of the list of books, and continue doing the same process with the remaining half, and so on until we have only one book."

    "Clearly, the number of steps is much less than doing a simple linear search (i.e.: going from left to right until we find the desired element). But for how much?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, if the array has length $1024$, in the first step we discard $512$ elements and we're left with $512$. In the second step we discard $256$ and we're left with $256$ elements. In the 3rd step we discard $128$ elements, and after the 4th step we're left with $64$ elements, and after the 5th step, we're left with $32$ elements, and after the 6th step with $16$, and $8$ after the 7th step, and $4$ after the 8th step, and $2$ after the 9th step, and finally a single element after the 10th steps. So, it took only 10 steps to find a number in a list of $1000$ elements."

Then we can use binary search over the time. So, given certain point in time $t$, we need to see if there was an intersection at any point before $t$. Because the ships are moving at a constant speed, once a ship intersects another one, they won't intersect again. Because the ships move with positive velocity, the only way a ship $A$ intersect another ship $B$ is if $A$ is located before $B$ and $A$ has higher speed. The position of the ship $i$ at time $t$ is $y_i(t) = x_i + v_i \\cdot t$. During the binary search, we go asking for certain points in time, and for each of them, we need to check if the ships intersected, and this means if they changed their relative order; therefore, we can just sort all ships according to their positions in the current time, and check if their order changed.\n"
